# Learning C Programming with CS50

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning the C programming language through Harvard's CS50 course.

## About

CS50 (Introduction to Computer Science) is a comprehensive entry-level course that covers foundational concepts in computer science and programming. This repository contains my solutions to course problems, projects, and exercises that demonstrate my progress and understanding of C programming.

## Contents

- **Problem Sets**: Solutions to the problem sets provided in the CS50 course.
- **Projects**: Completed projects and assignments from the course.
- **Notes**: My personal notes and summaries of key concepts learned.

## Course Structure

1. **Introduction to C**:
   - Basic syntax
   - Data types
   - Control structures (if, for, while)

2. **Functions and Arrays**:
   - Defining and using functions
   - Working with arrays and strings

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Pointers
   - Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free)

4. **Data Structures**:
   - Structs
   - Linked lists
   - Hash tables

5. **Algorithms**:
   - Sorting algorithms
   - Searching algorithms

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cs50-learning.git

2. **Navigate to the project**:
    ```bash
    cd cs50-learning/project_name

3. **Compile and Run**
Use make to compile the C files. For example:
    ```bash
    make program_name
    ./program_name

If make is not available, you can compile manually:

    gcc -o program_name program_name.c
    ./program_name
